# Binary Eye

Yet another barcode scanner for Android. As if there weren't [enough][play].

This one is totally free, open source and does use the [ZXing][zxing] barcode
scanning library.

Unlike many others, it works in portrait and landscape orientation, can read
inverted codes, comes in Material Design and doesn't do much else but decoding
a barcode.

And it's written in [Kotlin][kotlin] because I wanted to explore that a
bit more.
